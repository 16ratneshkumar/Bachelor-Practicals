### 📊 Sorting Algorithm Comparison (1-4)
For the algorithms at S. no 1 to 4, test run the algorithm on 100 different input sizes varying from 30 to 1000. For each size find the number of comparisons averaged on 10 different input instances; plot a graph for the average number of comparisons against each input size. Compare it with a graph of n logn.
