## 📅 List of Practical

0) [Design an FA that accepts a language over S={a, b} consisting of strings that do not contain a double a. Write a program to simulate this FA.](./example.cpp)
1) [Design a Finite Automata (FA) that accepts all strings over S={0, 1} having three consecutive 1's as a substring. Write a program to simulate this FA.](./1.cpp)
2) [Design a Finite Automata (FA) that accepts all strings over S={0, 1} having either exactly two 1's or exactly three 1's, not more nor less. Write a program to simulate this FA.](./2.cpp)
3) [Design a Finite Automata (FA) that accepts language L1, over S={a, b}, comprising of all strings (of length 4 or more) having first two characters same as the last two. Write a program to simulate this FA.](./3.cpp)
4) [Design a Finite Automata (FA) that accepts language L2, over S= {a, b} where L2= a(a+b)*b. Write a program to simulate this FA.](./4.cpp)
5) [Design a Finite Automata (FA) that accepts language EVEN-EVEN over S={a, b}. Write a program to simulate this FA](./5.cpp)
6) [Write a program to simulate an FA that accepts](./6.cpp)
    1. Union of the languages L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>
    2. Intersection of the languages L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>
    3. Language L<sub>1</sub> L<sub>2</sub> (concatenation)
7) [Design a PDA and write a program for simulating the machine which accepts the language {a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup> where n>0, S= {a, b}}.](./7.cpp)
8) [Design a PDA and write a program for simulating the machine which accepts the language {wXw<sup>r</sup> | w is any string over S={a, b} and wr is reverse of that string and X is a special symbol }.](./8.cpp)
9) [Design and simulate a Turing Machine that accepts the language a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup>c<sup>n</sup> where n >0.](./9.cpp)
10) [Design and simulate a Turing Machine which will increment the given binary number by 1.](./10.cpp)
