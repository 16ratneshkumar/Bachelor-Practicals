# DSC-16: Artificial Intelligence - Practicals

![Course](https://img.shields.io/badge/Course-DSC--16-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge)

Welcome to the collection of practical assignments for the **Artificial Intelligence** course. This repository contains implementations for various logic-based problems and algorithms using **Prolog**.

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

This project uses **Prolog**. We recommend using **SWI-Prolog** for running these programs.

**Quick Setup:**
1.  **Install SWI-Prolog:** Download and install from [swi-prolog.org](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).
2.  **Load the File:** Open the terminal in this directory and run:
    ```prolog
    ?- [practical].
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure you are loading the `.pl` file)*
3.  **Run Queries:** After loading, you can start querying predicates like `father(john, X).` or `factorial(5, F).`
