### 📅 List of Practicals

1. [Create A Class SET. Create Member Functions To Perform The Following SET Operations:](./1.py)
    1) Is Member: Check Whether An Element Belongs To The Set Or Not And Return Value As True/False.
    2) Powerset: List All The Elements Of The Power Set Of A Set .
    3) Subset: Check Whether One Set Is A Subset Of The Other Or Not.
    4) Union And Intersection Of Two Sets.
    5) Complement: Assume Universal Set As Per The Input Elements From The User.
    6) Set Difference And Symmetric Difference Between Two Sets.
    7) Cartesian Product Of Sets.
    
    Write A _Menu Driven Program To Perform The Above Functions On An Instance Of The SET Class.
2. [Create a class RELATION, use Matrix notation to represent a relation. Include member functions to check if the relation is Reflexive, Symmetric, Anti-symmetric, Transitive. Using these functions check whether the given relation is: Equivalence or Partial Order relation or None .](./2.py)
3. [Write a Program that generates all the permutations of a given set of digits, with or without repetition.](./3.py)
4. [For any number n, write a program to list all the solutions of the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + ...+ xn = C, where C is a constant (C<=10) and x1, x2,x3,...,xn are nonnegative integers, using brute force strategy.](./4.py)
5. [Write a Program to evaluate a polynomial function. (For example store f(x) = 4n2 + 2n + 9 in an array and for a given value of n, say n = 5, compute the value of f(n)).](./5.py)
6. [Write a Program to check if a given graph is a complete graph. Represent the graph using the Adjacency Matrix representation.](./6.py)
7. [Write a Program to check if a given graph is a complete graph. Represent the graph using the Adjacency List representation.](./7.py)
8. [Write a Program to accept a directed graph G and compute the in-degree and outdegree of each vertex.](./8.py)
