    3. Directory Management: cd, mkdir, rmdir, ls
2. [Execute various LINUX commands for:](<OS_Practical>)
    1. Process Control: fork, getpid, ps, kill, sleep 
    2. Communication: Input-output redirection, Pipe 
    3. Protection Management: chmod, chown, chgrp

### 📅 In C++

2. [Execute various LINUX commands for:](./C++/2.cpp) 
    1. Process Control: fork, getpid, ps, kill, sleep 
    2. Communication: Input-output redirection, Pipe 
    3. Protection Management: chmod, chown, chgrp

    1. same program, same code. 
    2. same program, different code. 
    3. before terminating, the parent waits for the child to finish its task.
